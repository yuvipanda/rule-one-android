Rule One (Android)
==================

An exploratory programming tool that lets people collaboratively write code using a web based editor and execute it on a particular android device - and use the specific capabilities of the device itself.

Uses the [Lua](http://www.lua.org) programming language.

Based off [AndroLua](https://github.com/mkottman/AndroLua).
